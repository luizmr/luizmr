### Hi there! 😁

My name is Luiz Marcelo Rocha from Brazil (🇧🇷). I'm working as a Senior Software Engineer nowadays, but I am a graduated Mechatronics Engineer too. I always have been passionate about programming, so I decided to work harder to become a developer and this is what I did. Now, I just want to be better, sharing what I know and never stop learning new stuff. 

In my free time I like to play video-games, going to the movies, and watch/play soccer (Corinthians fan all the way ⚫️⚪️).

Would you like to find me?
