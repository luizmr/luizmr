### Hi there! 😁

My name is Luiz Marcelo Rocha from Brazil (🇧🇷). I'm a Mechatronics Engineer, front-end lover and a quick learner. I always have been passionate about programming, so I decided to work harder to become a Front-end Dev and this is what I'm goingo to do. 

In my free time I like to play video-games, going to the movies, and watch/play soccer (Corinthians fan all the way ⚫️⚪️).

Would you like to find me?
